## 1. Project Purpose

* Users can select and submit orders for the N3D product range of printed foot insoles produced at [northotics.com](https://northotics.com/shop/semi-customised-orthosis/n3d/). 
* Users can create, retrieve and navigate through orders to update information, check production status and/or re-order products. 

N(3)orthotics was created as the third project while studying the [Code Instituteâ€™s Full Stack Software Developer course](https://codeinstitute.net/se/full-stack-software-development-diploma/). It has been built from the ground up to extend programming skills, demonstrate the use of python as a programming language and have some more fun. 

The application is targeted to those looking to implement similar python based concepts, while also attending to a common business need: *originating new orders in a simple way*.

## 2. User Experience Design

N(3)Orthotics is an app that aims to allow users to access order information quickly and easily. Each user decision, accessible by numerical selection, have been constructed to reflect an intuitive flow through a product ordering process. 

This has been derived from reviewing the first 4 of the 5 planes in the [User Experience Design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design). This process is  part of an overarching [User Centred Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) process that would be undertaken in the creation of a commercial project.

### Design
#### Structure
The application is intended to allow users to easily navigate through a product ordering process. A tree structure style of navigation allowing users to drill down and/or return to previous levels until their objectives are met.
#### Application Mockup & Wireframe
Four graphics of the application have been designed to show stakeholders and potential clients early concepts before any coding started. They provide a pre-build indication of: 
* The variety of functions required.
* The critical pathways of functions needed to reach each user outcome.
* The relationships between each function.
* The logical approach to code creation, promoting readability and aiding future fault-finding processes.
* The experience as users navigate through the order, retrieve, update and/or re-order processes.
